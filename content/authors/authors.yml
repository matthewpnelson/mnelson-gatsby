  bio: |
    I am a self proclaimed 'Data Enthusiast', but really I'm just enthusiastic about creating exciting things (especially those with plenty of data). 
    With an early career established in the Canadian Energy industry as a Professional Engineer, and now as an experiened Data Scientist 
    trained out of the University of California, Berkeley, I am uniquely suited to understand the operational and financial challenges of 
    corporations in traditional industries, while also suitably skilled to lead them into a technologically innovative future. I consider myself  
    business-savvy with a hands-on-keyboard mentality.
