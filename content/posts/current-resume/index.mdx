### WORK EXPERIENCE

#### CANLIN ENERGY CORPORATION / CENTRICA ENERGY
>

##### Corporate Data Scientist & Reserves Coordinator
Calgary, Alberta	
May 2019 - Present

- Spearheaded the establishment of new data workflows within the context of a major Information Systems restructuring project, helping balance the needs of different business units with the need to optimize the software requirements of the business. Was one of three members involved in the execution of project Cobalt, the IS restructuring project.
- Assisted in the establishment of a common Data Mart for use by most technical staff, replacing a legacy query system. Motivated the movement to Tableau as a common reporting and visualization tool, and served as the in-house Tableau expert. Wrote SQL queries to establish common tables and stored procedures for multiple business units to leverage through the Data Mart. 
- Created many Dashboards for business analyses and corporate summaries alike using Tableau, including lease operating statement analysis, price forecast comparisons, abandonment cost analysis, corporate disposition or acquisition impact analysis, and development program economic metric comparisons.
- Used a combination of SQL stored procedures and Tableau Prep to create ETL pipelines for certain key datasets, including a corporate facilities list, a corporate pipeline list, and abandonment data
- Utilized Completion Data from the Western Canadian Frac Database and used Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, seaborn) to determine the completion parameters that would be most productive for our high-profile growth Montney acreage. Explored the distribution for each feature (Lateral Length, Proppant Concentration, Fluid Pumped, # Stages, etc.) as well as the variation in the Gas and Oil Production rates and Expected Ultimate Recovery (EUR), exploring data completeness and doing clean-up where necessary. Built multiple predictive machine learning models that can be used to predict what the production & EUR would be for a well given specific input parameters. Explained the rationale and theory to most of the Development team and showcased the results in a simplified but still thorough manner.
- Used Python to automate the Abandonment and Reclamation Obligation (ARO) process. Data stored in small Access databases, messy text documents from the Regulator, and standalone excel spreadsheets was cleaned, munged/wrangled, specific calculations were applied, and the eventual result of 10,000+ wellbore, 5,000+ pipeline, and hundreds of facility liabilities was exported and viewed in dashboards using PowerBI. Through this process simple clustering algorithms were also leveraged to maintain consistency to previous iterations of the ARO calculation.
- Proposed a way for management & HR to represent the complex interconnections between employees by using a graph database (Neo4j). This methodology included titles, hierarchical structure (reporting relationships), roles and responsibilities related to key processes in the company, and even data flow within those process whether automated or manual. Different queries could be run on one single but complete database to see different aspects of the business depending on need.
- Served as a key member of the ‘Internal Data Management Committee’ discussing any and all changes to systems and data processes in Canlin.



##### Corporate Reserves Coordinator
Calgary, Alberta	
Oct 2017 – May 2019

- Managed all aspects of the annual NI 51-101 compliant Corporate Reserves process which evaluates the lifetime value of all current and identified future projects owned by the company. This process integrates all aspects of oil and gas development, requiring a broad understanding of the industry and a tight integration with domain specific experts within the company. 
- Developed a data pipeline to extract accurate, detailed, and robust summaries of the completed or in-process Reserves Evaluation, helping myself, our Engineers, and Management discover the intricacies in our Reserve Book in near real-time.
- Introduced an interactive data visualization framework (using PowerBI) and developed multiple dashboards designed to provide updates and an overview of the official Corporate Reserves data. These dashboards have been heavily utilized by the Engineering staff during validation of the Reserves and by Management as an effective summary. 
- Produced accurate reports and summaries for all Management, Finance, Acquisition & Divestiture, Audit, and internal Operation ad hoc requests related to the Reserves Book.
- Was a core member of the Corporate Acquisition & Divestiture team, which actively disposed of multiple properties in a depressed pricing environment, strengthening our business.
- Developed a framework for the iterative evaluation of a Corporate Strategy that lends support for major portfolio changes, including detailed volume and cash flow forecasts, overall economic indicators, ability to fund using disposition proceeds or debt, and integrated with detailed financial models. This framework included the ability to adjust Divestment candidates, Acquisition candidates, and all forms of Organic Growth in real-time using PowerBI. Clearly presented the framework, multiple learned themes, and a shortlist of most-desirable scenarios to all stakeholders and empowered their participation in the process.


##### Exploitation Engineer, Foothills and South
Calgary, Alberta	
July 2014 – Oct 2017
- Defined an extremely complex and long-term strategy by analysing over 200 scenarios on their equivalent technical and economic merits. Developed multiple spreadsheet tools required to properly analyse each scenario and created a ranked evaluation of preferred strategies for management which was integral in structuring long term deals with 3rd parties and in creating future plans for Centrica’s facilities.
- Analysed a wealth of historical data and trends in the Panther River field and developed a robust long-term development plan based on an evolution of well completion systems.
- Analysed the existing gathering systems for all natural gas plants in South-West Alberta to determine the long-term viability of specific plants and a multitude of likely scenarios for eventual turndown or abandonment. Provided strategic recommendations to management related to actions available to Centrica that could influence the longevity of Centrica’s owned and operated gas plants, defining corporate direction for the company’s Foothills assets over the next 5-10 years. 
- Developed a network of spreadsheets linked through VBA to provide Centrica Canada’s development teams with a single repository for all potential opportunities for tracking and planning purposes. The system was adopted across the company and provided management with a single source for information on identified projects, the ability to sort and select projects to push to the next ‘stage’, numerical tracking of the number of projects teams created each month, hypothetical yearly budget creations and a look-back function for completed projects. 
- Day-to-day exploitation engineering responsibilities including project economic evaluations, technical support for auxiliary team members, regulatory matters, reserve reviews, report writing and area development plan creation and presentations, amongst others. 
- Fully evaluated and prepared a number of acquisition and disposition candidates.

#### PENGROWTH ENERGY CORPORATION	
Production Engineer, In-Situ Development

June 2013 – June 2014
- Created process flow diagrams for each plant system and generated long term trends for every transmitter in order to analyse plant performance.
- Designed a multi-dimensional steam chamber tracking spreadsheet which utilizes thermocouple data from steam injectors, producers and observation wells to track areal temperature changes with respect to time.
- Created a detailed process flow diagram for the commercial SAGD facility to use for training purposes.
- Tracked well pair performance through production and steam injection rates, pressure monitoring, subcool analysis, and pump operation. 
- Built an interactive spreadsheet comparing every current SAGD project in Alberta in detail.


##### Exploitation Engineer, Greater Jenner and Bodo Areas
Calgary, Alberta
August 2010 – June 2013
